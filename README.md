# folsec-auditor

**NTFS / ACL Risk Auditor — Point-in-Time Gap Analyzer for Enterprise File Servers**

A single, statically linked `.exe` written in Rust. Scans NTFS directory trees at high speed using direct Win32 API calls, then produces a self-contained HTML report exposing over-permissive ACEs, inheritance breaks, orphaned SIDs, and SIEM blind spots — with a dry-run PowerShell remediation script included.

Built as an open-source gap analysis tool for [FolSec](https://folsec.com), a platform providing continuous NTFS governance and real-time audit visibility. This tool shows you what's broken **right now**. FolSec tells you the moment it changes.

## What It Finds

| Risk | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Over-permissive ACE | `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` | `Everyone`, `Authenticated Users`, or `BUILTIN\Users` with write / modify / full control |
| Inheritance break | `MEDIUM` | Folder explicitly blocks inherited permissions — creates a hidden permission island invisible to top-down audits |
| Orphaned SID | `LOW` | ACE references a SID that cannot be resolved — typically a deleted AD user or group |
| Null DACL | `CRITICAL` | No DACL present at all — Windows interprets this as implicit allow-all for every user on the system |
| Anomaly simulated | `CRITICAL` | 2,500 rapid ACL changes went undetected — your SIEM has no real-time NTFS visibility |

---

## Output

**1. Self-contained HTML report**
A single `.html` file with an embedded interactive findings table, severity filters, path search, and a FolSec CTA. No server, no CDN dependency after first load. Safe to email or copy to USB for air-gapped review.

**2. Dry-run PowerShell remediation script** (`scripts/remediate_dry_run.ps1`)
Every finding maps to a documented `Write-Host "Would remove..."` block. The script never calls `Set-Acl` or `icacls` with side effects — it is a change management artifact, not an execution script.

---

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Scan a UNC share
folsec-auditor.exe scan --root "\\fileserver01\HR" --output report.html

# Scan with a dry-run remediation script
folsec-auditor.exe scan --root "C:\DataFiles" --output report.html --remediation scripts\remediate_dry_run.ps1

# Fast triage — limit depth on a large share
folsec-auditor.exe scan --root "D:\Projects" --output report.html --max-depth 4

# Expose SIEM blind spots with the anomaly simulator
folsec-auditor.exe scan --root "C:\DataFiles" --output report.html --simulate-anomaly

# Reduce CPU impact on a production server
folsec-auditor.exe scan --root "\\nas\share" --output report.html --threads 4
```

## Building from Source

**Requirements:** Rust stable (`rustup`), Windows host or MSVC cross-compilation setup.

```powershell
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/aymaan-balbale/folsec_auditorV1.git
cd folsec_auditorV1

# Build a statically linked release binary (no MSVC runtime dependency)
$env:RUSTFLAGS = "-C target-feature=+crt-static"
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Binary output
.\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\folsec-auditor.exe
```

> **CI note:** `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` run cleanly on Linux/macOS — the Win32 API calls are gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`. Non-Windows builds produce an empty-findings report, which is useful for testing report output in CI.

### Release Profile

`Cargo.toml` configures the release build for a minimal, deployment-ready binary:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level     = 3
lto           = true        # Link-Time Optimization — reduces binary ~30%
codegen-units = 1           # Max optimization per compilation unit
strip         = true        # Strip debug symbols
panic         = "abort"     # No stack unwinding — smaller binary, faster exit
```

```

### How the Scanner Works

1. **`walkdir`** streams directory entries lazily — no full-tree RAM load, handles deeply nested SMB shares without locking memory.
2. **`rayon::par_bridge()`** turns that sequential stream into a parallel one, distributing entries across the thread pool. On a 16-core server this is 8–12× faster than single-threaded scanning.
3. **`acl.rs`** calls `GetNamedSecurityInfoW` for each directory, extracts the DACL, and iterates ACEs via `GetAce`. A `SecurityDescriptorGuard` RAII wrapper ensures `LocalFree` is always called — even if an error short-circuits traversal mid-ACE.
4. **`sid.rs`** resolves each SID to an account name via the two-call `LookupAccountSidW` pattern (size probe → allocate → resolve), with explicit `ERROR_NONE_MAPPED` handling for orphaned SIDs.
5. **`dashmap`** accumulates findings across threads without a global lock.
6. Results are sorted by severity descending, then written to the HTML report and optional `.ps1` script.

## Anomaly Simulator — `--simulate-anomaly`

Proves in real time whether your SIEM has NTFS audit visibility.

**What it does:**

1. Creates a hidden temporary directory (`.tmp_folsec_audit`) under the scan root.
2. Generates **50 dummy files** inside it.
3. Cycles each file's ACL **50 times** in rapid succession — **2,500 permission-change events in under 2 seconds** — replicating the ACL manipulation pattern used by ransomware before encrypting files.
4. Deletes the directory and all dummy files.
5. Produces a `CRITICAL` finding in the report: *did your SIEM alert during step 3?*

A correctly configured environment (Windows Security Audit Policy → "Audit Object Access", forwarding Event IDs **4656 / 4663 / 4670** to your SIEM) will fire during step 3. Silence means a blind spot.

> ⚠️ **Authorized use only.** Run this only on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. The simulator creates and deletes only its own temporary files — no production data is read, modified, or encrypted.

## The Dry-Run Remediation Script

Every finding maps to a self-documenting block in the generated `.ps1`. Example output:

```powershell
# Finding #1: [HIGH] \\fileserver01\HR\Payroll
# Risk: Trustee 'Everyone' has over-permissive access (Full Control).
#       This creates a wide blast radius for ransomware or insider threats.

# LIVE COMMAND (review before use):
# icacls '\\fileserver01\HR\Payroll' /remove:g 'Everyone'
# Or with Set-Acl:
# $acl = Get-Acl -Path '\\fileserver01\HR\Payroll'
# $ace = $acl.Access | Where-Object { $_.IdentityReference -eq 'Everyone' }
# $acl.RemoveAccessRule($ace)
# Set-Acl -Path '\\fileserver01\HR\Payroll' -AclObject $acl

$ActionCount++
Write-Host "[DRY-RUN] #1: Would REMOVE ACE for 'Everyone' (Full Control) on path:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  >> '\\fileserver01\HR\Payroll'" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

The script never calls `Set-Acl` or `icacls` with side effects. Each block includes the live command as a comment so the change management team knows exactly what production execution would do.

## Core Dependencies

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `windows` | 0.58 | Win32 API bindings: `GetNamedSecurityInfoW`, `GetSecurityDescriptorDacl`, `LookupAccountSidW` |
| `walkdir` | 2.5 | Lazy depth-first directory traversal with graceful error handling |
| `rayon` | 1.10 | Work-stealing thread pool for parallel ACL extraction |
| `clap` | 4.5 | Typed CLI argument parsing with derive macros and `--help` generation |
| `serde` + `serde_json` | 1.0 | Serializes findings into the HTML report's embedded JSON data island |
| `dashmap` | 6.0 | Lock-minimizing concurrent HashMap for cross-thread accumulation |
| `thiserror` | 1.0 | Typed error enum — every failure mode is named, never `.unwrap()` |
| `indicatif` | 0.17 | Live progress spinner during long scans |
| `chrono` | 0.4 | Report timestamps |

---

## Why Not Just Use `icacls` / `Get-Acl`?

| | `icacls` / `Get-Acl` | folsec-auditor |
|---|---|---|
| Speed on 500k+ dirs | Minutes–hours (single-threaded) | Seconds–minutes (all CPU cores) |
| Risk classification | None — raw output only | Automatic severity scoring |
| Orphaned SID detection | Manual cross-reference required | Built-in via `LookupAccountSidW` |
| Inheritance break detection | Requires custom scripting | Automatic via SD control flags |
| Report output | Terminal text / CSV | Filterable interactive HTML |
| Remediation script | Manual authoring | Auto-generated dry-run `.ps1` |
| SIEM gap detection | Not possible | Anomaly simulator built-in |
| Deployment | Requires PowerShell / RSAT | Single `.exe`, zero dependencies |

## Known Limitations (V1)

- **Windows only.** NTFS ACL scanning uses Win32 APIs unavailable on other platforms.
- **Directories only.** Files inherit permissions from their parent folder — scanning every file would multiply Win32 API calls with minimal additional signal.
- **DACL only.** No SACL (audit policy), owner SID, or group SID analysis in V1.
- **Anomaly simulator spawns `icacls` child processes.** V2 will use `SetNamedSecurityInfoW` directly for sub-500ms cycling and no process spawn overhead.
- **No AD connectivity.** Orphaned SID detection is local — the tool cannot distinguish a deleted account from a merely disabled one without LDAP access.
- **No incremental/delta scanning.** Every run is a full point-in-time pass. Continuous monitoring requires [FolSec](https://folsec.com).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For significant changes, open an issue first.

```bash
# Compile check + lint (works on Linux/macOS)
cargo check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run unit tests
cargo test
```

Please keep all Win32 API calls inside `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]` guards so CI on Linux remains clean.
